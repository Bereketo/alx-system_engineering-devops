 0x11. What happens when you type google.com in your browser and press Enter
 
 This post briefly explains what happens on the background when you type http://www.google.com and hit enter
 1. DNS Request
 The first step is to translate the domain name 'www.google.com' into an IP address. This is done by the browser 
 sending a request to the local DNS resolver, which is usually provided by your internet service provider(ISP).
 The DNS resolver returns the IP address of the Google web server. 
 
 2. TCP/IP
 Once the IP address is obtained, the browser establishes a connection with the Google web server using 
 Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol(TCP/IP). This protocol ensures that the data is transmitted
 accurately and reliably between the browser and the web server.

 3. Firewall
 Before the data is transmitted, it may be checked by a firewall to ensure that it meets the security requirements.
 The firewall may block the connection if it detects any suspicious or malicious activity.

 4. HTTP/SSL
 Once the connection is established, the browser sends request to the web server using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
 For secure websites like Google, the request is sent is sent over Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS)
 to encrypt the data and protect it from eavesdropping.

 5. Load-Balancer
 The request is then redirected to a load balancer, which is responsible for distributing the incoming traffic across multiple web servers.
 This helps to handle the high volume of traffic and ensures that the website remains available even if one of the web server fails.

 6. Web Server 
 The Load-balancer forwards the request to a web server, which is responsible for processing the request and returning the necessary data.
 The web server retrieves the requested information from the cache or generates it dynamically using server-side scripting.
 
 7. Application Server 
 If the requested information is complex and requires additional processing, the web server may forward the request 
 to an application server. The application server performs the necessary calculations and returns the result to the web server.
 
 8. Database
 If the requested information is stored in a database, the application query the database and retrieve the necessary data.
 The database returns the data to the application server, which then returns it to the web server.

 Finally, the web server returns the data to the browser, which renders it on the screen as as webpage. This is a simplified 
 explanation on what happens when you type "http://www.google.com" in your browser and hit enter. The actual process is 
 much more complex and involves many other components, but these are the key steps involved in fetching and displaying a website.
